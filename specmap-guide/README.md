## 🎯 System Features

### **Agent Philosophy: "Brilliant Recent Graduates"**
All AI agents are designed as exceptionally talented recent graduates who:
- ✅ Have superior technical knowledge and analytical capabilities
- ✅ Possess comprehensive understanding of their specialized domains  
- ❌ Lack real-world experience and practical wisdom
- ❌ Need collaboration and guidance on business context

### **Key Behavioral Requirements**
- **Always explain reasoning in detail** - don't just state conclusions
- **Break down complex concepts** - assume collaborator needs full explanation
- **Seek validation frequently** - especially on business priorities and context
- **Collaborate rather than assume** - treat user as experienced mentor

## 🛠️ Components

### **1. Project Initialization**
- Automated folder structure creation
- Template file generation with RULEMAP headers
- Agent configuration setup
- Project charter and configuration templates

### **2. AI Agent System**
Four specialized agents handle the complete development workflow:

#### **PRD Generator Agent**
- Requirements analysis and documentation
- RULEMAP-structured PRD creation
- Stakeholder interview guidance
- Business requirement validation

#### **Task Planner Agent**
- Implementation planning and breakdown
- Technical dependency analysis
- Development roadmap creation
- Effort estimation and sequencing

#### **Development Guide Agent**
- Implementation guidance and support
- Code review and quality feedback
- Testing and deployment coordination
- Developer mentoring and education

#### **QA Monitor Agent**
- Quality assurance and RULEMAP scoring
- Risk identification and improvement recommendations
- Compliance validation and reporting
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### **3. Session Management**
- Comprehensive session tracking for all agent work
- Progress monitoring and performance metrics
- Knowledge capture and handoff documentation
- Historical analysis and improvement insights

## 📊 RULEMAP Framework
