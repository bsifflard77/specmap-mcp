# GitHub Spec-Kit + RULEMAP-PRD Integration Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive integration strategy for merging GitHub's Spec-Kit with the RULEMAP-PRD system. The integration combines Spec-Kit's proven spec-driven development workflow with RULEMAP-PRD's structured agent-based approach and comprehensive project management framework.

The resulting hybrid system will provide:
- **Unified CLI** combining `specify` commands with `rulemap` initialization
- **Enhanced workflow** merging Spec-Kit's constitution → specify → clarify → plan → tasks → implement pipeline with RULEMAP's agent-driven PRD → Task Planning → Development → QA phases
- **Improved templates** that incorporate RULEMAP structure into Spec-Kit's specification and planning templates
- **Integrated agent management** leveraging both systems' AI agent philosophies
- **Comprehensive project lifecycle** from initial concept through deployment with structured tracking

## Comparative Analysis

### System Philosophy Comparison

| Aspect | Spec-Kit | RULEMAP-PRD | Integration Opportunity |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Core Philosophy** | Specifications drive implementation (SDD) | Structured requirements using RULEMAP framework | Merge SDD with RULEMAP structure |
| **Workflow Approach** | Linear progression through phases | Agent-orchestrated parallel development | Combine linear spec phases with agent coordination |
| **AI Integration** | Multi-agent CLI support (Claude, Gemini, etc.) | Specialized RULEMAP agents (4 roles) | Unified agent system supporting both approaches |
| **Project Structure** | Feature-branch based with /specs, /plans, /tasks | Comprehensive 8-folder project structure | Hybrid structure supporting both paradigms |
| **Templates** | Focused spec/plan/task templates | Complete RULEMAP-structured templates | Enhanced templates combining both strengths |
| **Quality Control** | Constitution-based validation | RULEMAP scoring (>=8.0 threshold) | Dual validation system |

### Workflow Comparison

#### Spec-Kit Workflow
```
Constitution → Specify → Clarify → Plan → Tasks → Implement
```

#### RULEMAP-PRD Workflow
```
Project Init → PRD Generation → Task Planning → Development → QA Validation
```

#### Integrated Workflow
```
Constitution + Charter → Specify (RULEMAP-enhanced) → Clarify → Plan (Agent-driven) → Tasks (Agent-generated) → Implement (Agent-guided) → QA (RULEMAP scoring)
```
