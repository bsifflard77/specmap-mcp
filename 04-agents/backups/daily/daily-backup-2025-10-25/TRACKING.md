## Team Notes

### What's Working Well
- FastMCP makes MCP integration straightforward
- Template pattern for skills is flexible and extensible
- Rich CLI output provides excellent UX
- Documentation-first approach pays off

### Areas for Improvement
- Need more integration tests
- Should add more example projects
- Could benefit from video tutorials

### Lessons Learned
- Start with clear structure (SpecMap methodology)
- Document as you build, not after
- Test incrementally
- Keep skills focused and composable
