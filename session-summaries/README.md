# Session Summaries

This directory contains daily development session summaries following the SpecMap RULEMAP methodology.

## Purpose

Session summaries provide:
- **Accountability**: Track what was accomplished each day
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Share context with team members
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor velocity and completion
- **Decision Documentation**: Record why choices were made
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure RULEMAP compliance

## File Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

**Examples**:
- `2025-10-18.md` - October 18, 2025 session
- `2025-10-19.md` - October 19, 2025 session

## Session Summary Structure

Each session summary follows this RULEMAP-based template:

### 1. Header
- Session date, type, duration
- Focus area and status

### 2. RULEMAP Analysis
Each session is analyzed using all 7 RULEMAP elements:
- **R** - Roles, decisions, stakeholders
- **U** - Problems solved, objectives achieved
- **L** - Technical approach and decisions
- **E** - Components implemented, constraints
- **M** - User experience and emotional targets
- **A** - Audience impact and stakeholder value
- **P** - Metrics, success criteria, RULEMAP score

### 3. Accomplishments
- Features delivered
- Code metrics
- Test results

### 4. Technical Details
- Architecture decisions
- Integration points
- Code samples

### 5. Lessons Learned
- What worked well
- Challenges overcome
- Technical decisions rationale

### 6. Next Steps
- Immediate priorities
- Short-term goals
- Long-term roadmap

### 7. Quality Checklist
- Implementation status
- Testing coverage
- Documentation completeness
- Quality score

### 8. Session Metrics
- Time breakdown
- Productivity measures
- Velocity tracking

### 9. Retrospective
- Continue doing
- Start doing
- Stop doing

### 10. Sign-Off
- Completion status
- Next session focus
- RULEMAP score
- Constitution compliance

## Usage

### During Development

**Start of Session**:
```bash
# Create new session file
cp session-summaries/TEMPLATE.md session-summaries/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

**During Session**:
- Note accomplishments as you work
- Document decisions and rationale
- Track time spent on tasks
- Record challenges and solutions

**End of Session**:
- Complete RULEMAP analysis
- Calculate metrics
- Run quality checklist
- Perform retrospective
- Sign off with RULEMAP score

### Using the Template

Copy `TEMPLATE.md` and fill in each section:

1. **Replace placeholders** with actual values
2. **Complete RULEMAP sections** with real analysis
3. **Add code samples** for key implementations
4. **Include metrics** from actual work
5. **Be honest** in retrospective
6. **Calculate RULEMAP score** objectively

## Quality Standards

Every session summary must:
- ✅ Follow RULEMAP structure
- ✅ Include all 7 RULEMAP elements
- ✅ Document technical decisions
- ✅ Record accomplishments
- ✅ Include metrics
- ✅ Have retrospective
- ✅ Calculate RULEMAP score
- ✅ Sign off with constitution compliance

**Target RULEMAP Score**: >= 8.0

## Examples

### Good Session Summary
- Complete RULEMAP analysis
- Specific accomplishments with metrics
- Technical details with code samples
- Honest retrospective
- Clear next steps
- High RULEMAP score (8-10)

### Incomplete Session Summary
- Missing RULEMAP sections
- Vague accomplishments
- No metrics
- No technical details
- Missing retrospective

**Always aim for complete, high-quality summaries.**

## Session Summary Template

Use [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md) as the starting point for each session.

## Review Process

### Daily Review (End of Day)
- Self-review: Check completeness
- Calculate RULEMAP score
- Validate constitution compliance
- Sign off

### Weekly Review (Friday)
- Review all week's sessions
- Calculate weekly metrics
- Identify patterns
- Plan next week

### Monthly Review
- Aggregate monthly progress
- Review velocity trends
- Assess quality scores
- Update roadmap

## Integration with Tracking

Session summaries complement [TRACKING.md](../TRACKING.md):

- **TRACKING.md**: High-level project status, milestones, metrics
- **Session Summaries**: Daily detailed logs with RULEMAP analysis

Update TRACKING.md after each session summary.

## Metrics Tracked

### Productivity Metrics
- Lines of code written
- Features completed
- Tests written
- Documentation pages

### Quality Metrics
- RULEMAP score (per session)
- Test coverage
- Constitution compliance
- Code review feedback

### Time Metrics
- Session duration
- Time per task type
- Velocity trends

### Satisfaction Metrics
- Mood/energy levels
- Confidence in work
- Blocker impact

## Best Practices

### Writing Session Summaries

**Do**:
- Write while details are fresh
- Be specific and measurable
- Include code examples
- Document decisions rationally
- Be honest about challenges
- Calculate real metrics

**Don't**:
- Wait until end of week
- Be vague or generic
- Skip RULEMAP analysis
- Inflate accomplishments
- Hide problems
- Fake metrics

### RULEMAP Scoring

Score each element honestly (0-10):
- **9-10**: Excellent - comprehensive, detailed
- **7-8**: Good - complete, adequate
- **5-6**: Fair - basic, needs improvement
- **3-4**: Poor - incomplete, inadequate
- **0-2**: Very Poor - missing or severely lacking

Average the scores for overall RULEMAP score.

**Threshold**: >= 8.0 for session to be considered "complete"

## Tools & Automation

### Helper Scripts (Future)

```bash
# Create today's session
./scripts/new-session.sh

# Finalize session (calculate metrics)
./scripts/finalize-session.sh

# Weekly summary
./scripts/weekly-summary.sh

# Monthly summary
./scripts/monthly-summary.sh
```

## Archive

Completed sessions are kept permanently for:
- Historical reference
- Knowledge base
- Pattern analysis
- Onboarding new team members
- Project retrospectives

**Never delete session summaries.**

## Contributing

When adding sessions:
1. Use the template
2. Follow the structure
3. Complete all sections
4. Calculate RULEMAP score
5. Update TRACKING.md
6. Commit with clear message
